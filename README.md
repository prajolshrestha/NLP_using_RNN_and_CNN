# Spam Detection using RNN and CNN

This project demonstrates two approaches to spam detection using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
Both models are implemented using TensorFlow 2.0.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the spam.csv dataset. It contains SMS messages labeled as either "ham" or "spam".

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code in this project:

TensorFlow 2.0
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn


## Results
Both models achieve high accuracy on the test set:

RNN: 98.6%
CNN: 97.6%

## Future Work
Possible future improvements to the models include:

Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve performance
Experimenting with different architectures
Using pre-trained embeddings
